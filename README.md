## Abstract

Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous malignancy, and accurate molecular subtyping based on the PAM50 standard is crucial for clinical treatment decisions and prognosis prediction. While deep learning methods have been widely applied to biomedical data analysis tasks, existing approaches often rely on single data modalities, failing to capture the complex biological landscape involving multi-layered molecular mechanisms across genomics, transcriptomics, and other omics levels. The increasing availability of multi-omics data offers potential for comprehensive tumor characterization, yet effectively integrating multi-omics data with clinical information remains a core challenge.

To address these challenges, we propose **ClinicalAnchor-Gated Multi-Omics Fusion Network (CAGMF-Net)**, a deep learning framework with gated fusion mechanisms designed to integrate four modalities—clinical features, single nucleotide variants (SNV), copy number alterations (CNA), and gene expression (RNA)—for accurate PAM50 subtype prediction. The framework employs modality-specific encoders to learn latent representations and introduces a gated fusion mechanism anchored on clinical features for adaptive information integration.

Furthermore, to enhance model robustness and generalization, we introduce **CAGMF-Net with Model Averaging (CAGMF-Net-MA)**. By constructing candidate models with different modality combinations and optimizing weights through cross-validation, this strategy achieves superior predictive performance.

**Key Results:**

- CAGMF-Net significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-modality approaches
- The cross-validation-based model averaging strategy achieves optimal performance among various model selection and averaging methods
- Progressive addition of omics modalities (CNA → SNV → RNA) to clinical features steadily improves classification performance, confirming that each data type contributes unique information
- Strong generalization performance validated on external TCGA dataset
